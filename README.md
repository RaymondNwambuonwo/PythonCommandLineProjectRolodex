# Python-Command-Line-App
# Rolodex

This project is a command line application that acts as a Rolodex to store new contacts.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/RaymondNwambuonwo/PythonCommandLineProjectRolodex.git
```
2. Change into the directory
```
cd PythonCommandLineProjectRolodex
```
3. Install dependencies
```
pip install peewee psycopg2
```
4. Run
```
python3 rolodex.py
```

## Features

  * List all contacts 
  * Search for a contact by name
  * Create a contact
  * Update a contact
  * Delete contact
  * See all contacts stored

## Technologies used

1. Python
2. SQL
3. peewee

## Future Development
I would like to implement a graphical user interface (GUI) so the layout will be more user friendly. This was my first time creating a python command application, having learned python in 2 days, and it was been a great first time experience.
